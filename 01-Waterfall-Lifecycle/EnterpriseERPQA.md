# Enterprise ERP QA – Waterfall Case Study

## Project Overview

This repository presents a structured QA case study based on an Enterprise Procurement & Inventory Management ERP system.

The project simulates a real-world enterprise implementation following a primarily Waterfall model, later incorporating controlled Agile-style defect management practices.

---

## Business Background

A mid-sized manufacturing organization required a centralized ERP system to manage:

- Vendor onboarding
- Purchase order lifecycle
- Goods receipt validation
- Inventory tracking
- Invoice matching (3-way matching)
- Financial ledger posting

The objective was to improve data accuracy, eliminate duplicate vendor records, and ensure end-to-end traceability across procurement and finance modules.

## Development Model

The project followed a structured Waterfall lifecycle:

1. Business Requirement Documentation (BRD)
2. Functional Specification (FRS)
3. Test Strategy & Planning
4. System Testing
5. Integration Testing
6. User Acceptance Testing
7. Production Deployment

Later phases introduced Agile-style defect triage and iterative build validation to optimize release cycles.
