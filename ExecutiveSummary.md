**Executive Summary**
L&T Healthcare E-Commerce QA Process Framework Simulation

**Project Overview**

This project simulates a healthcare e-commerce platform developed under an enterprise delivery model inspired by Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

The objective of this simulation was to demonstrate structured QA governance across both traditional and Agile execution models, showcasing end-to-end Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) implementation.

**The system includes:**
- User Registration & Login
- Product Catalog Management
- Cart & Checkout
- Payment Processing
- Order Confirmation
- Delivery Approach

**The project followed a hybrid execution model:**
- Mini-Waterfall Phase
- BRD & FRD documentation
- Test Strategy creation
- RTM preparation
- Initial risk assessment
- Scrum-Based Agile Execution
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Product backlog & sprint backlog management
- Continuous QA involvement
- Sprint reviews & defect triage

This hybrid approach demonstrates adaptability across enterprise delivery environments.

**QA Strategy & Governance**

QA was integrated from requirement analysis through production readiness.

**Key QA Activities:**
- Requirement review & ambiguity resolution
- Test case design & execution
- Risk-based prioritization
- Defect lifecycle management
- Regression testing before release
- Sprint-level reporting

**Artifacts produced:**
- BRD / FRD
- RTM
- Test Plan & Test Strategy
- Test Execution Reports
- Agile Backlog & Sprint Documents
- Defect Log (Sprint-wise classification)
- Defect Metrics Summary

**Across two Agile sprints:**

- Total Defects Identified: 20
- Critical: 3
- Medium: 9
- Low: 8

All Critical defects were resolved before sprint closure, ensuring production readiness.

**Project Outcome**
- Sprint goals achieved across both cycles
- Full functional coverage validated
- Regression suite passed successfully
- Release approved by Product Owner

**The project demonstrates:**

✔ Strong understanding of SDLC & STLC
✔ Ability to work in Waterfall and Agile models
✔ Structured documentation skills
✔ Risk-based testing approach
✔ Enterprise-level defect governance

**Conclusion**

This QA Process Framework Simulation highlights the ability to operate within structured enterprise environments while adapting to Agile methodologies.

The project showcases both strategic planning and hands-on QA execution capability suitable for mid-level QA and hybrid automation roles.
